#RemoteLPT setup help

Setting up an OpenVMS print queue for RemoteLPT

*** BEFORE YOU DO THIS ***
Make sure your Alpha emulator is set up to have a second serial port to listen to a TCP Telnet port.  See your documentation on this.  
For for AXPBOX, I've been using port 9110 but it can be anything.  In FreeAXP or EmuVM, these can be configured in much the same way 
using the GUI configuration tool.  RemoteLPT will ignore any banners that are sent, only settling down after 5 seconds of silence from 
the emulator.  If your emulator allows it, and you're running this project on the same machine as the emulator, you can set the startup
application for the second console port to the full path to the RemoteLPT application.  This will start the printer when the emulator
starts.

Log into Open VMS as with SYSTEM privileges.

SET PROC/PRIV=ALL

If you dont already have the queue manager started, you can enter...
START/QUEUE/MANAGER/NEW

Define the DEFAULT form
DEFINE/FORM /MARGIN=(TOP=0,BOTTOM=0) DEFAULT 0

This will create a default form with no top or bottom margin.  If you want to turn on flag pages, you can with this command.  HELP DEFINE FORM 
will show you how to do this.  Make sure you have the form properly defined BEFORE you create the SYS$PRINT print queue.  If you change it 
later, delete the SYS$PRINT queue and re-create it with the commands below.

Set up the SYS$PRINT queue
If you already have one, you can delete it with
STOP/QUEUE/NEXT SYS$PRINT
DELETE/QUEUE SYS$PRINT

Now, create the SYS$PRINT queue with
INITIALIZE/QUEUE/START/ON=TTA0:/DEFAULT=(FEED,FORM=DEFAULT) SYS$PRINT
This will establish the SYS$PRINT queue as an autostart queue pointing towards TTA0: which RemoteLPT will connect to.
Start RemoteLPT and set up the connection parameters, then click the START button.  If all goes well, it'll connect to your emulator, and settle.

SET DEF SYS$STARTUP
PRINT SYSTARTUP_VMS.COM
You should see...
Job WELCOME (queue SYS$PRINT, entry 158) started on SYS$PRINTPRINT WELCOME.TXT
If everything is configured properly, the welcome.txt should be printed on your windows printer.

My SYSTARTUP_VMS.COM has these lines
$ DEFINE /SYSTEM $PRINTER TTA0:
$ SET TERMINAL $PRINTER/PERMANENT/page=66/width=135/device_type=la120
$ SET DEVICE /SPOOLED=(SYS$PRINT, SYS$SYSDEVICE:) $PRINTER

VMS can be a bit finicky in my experience.  You may have a better solution, and unless you're experienced with DCL
error handling, any error in SYSTARTUP_VMS.COM will terminate the processing.  Anything after that won't happen
which is usually TCP/IP networking, and any language processing etc.  Sometimes judicious 

$ WRITE SYS$OUTPUT "Short description of what's happening"

immediately before the command will give you a hint as where any problems are occurring.  Mind you, messing around
with SYSTARTUP_VMS.COM is on you.  If you manage to get your system to not start, don't blame me.

I am SO not a VMS expert.  If anyone has a better (or even correct) way of doing this, please let me know.
All I can say at this point, is that it currently works for me.

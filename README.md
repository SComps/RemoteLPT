# RemoteLPT
If you were previously watching the repository, I had to delete and re-create it.

Remote LPT is a windows application that allows printing from emulators such as AXPBOX, FreeAXP and EmuVM.

The emulator needs to be configured to accept a TELNET connection on one of it's console ports.  With
OpenVMS, configure that console port as a printer, connect it to a print queue and you're off and running.
There are numerous configuration options for fonts, and printer types.  At this point, lines per page is 
hard coded at 66 lines per page, and landscape mode.  This is suitable for most VMS type printers.

Furthur documentation will be available soon.
